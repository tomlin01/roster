# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build          # Compile TypeScript (src/ → dist/)
npm run dev            # Watch mode compilation
npm run lint           # Type-check only (tsc --noEmit)
npm test               # Run all tests (vitest run)
npm run test:watch     # Vitest watch mode
node dist/cli/oma.js help   # After build: shell/CI CLI (`oma` when installed via npm bin)
```

Tests live in `tests/` (vitest). Examples in `examples/` are standalone scripts requiring API keys (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`). CLI usage and JSON schemas: `docs/cli.md`.

## Architecture

ES module TypeScript framework for multi-agent orchestration. Three runtime dependencies: `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `openai`, `zod`.

### Core Execution Flow

**`OpenMultiAgent`** (`src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`) is the top-level public API with three execution modes:

1. **`runAgent(config, prompt)`** — single agent, one-shot
2. **`runTeam(team, goal)`** — automatic orchestration: a temporary "coordinator" agent decomposes the goal into a task DAG via LLM call, then tasks execute in dependency order
3. **`runTasks(team, tasks)`** — explicit task pipeline with user-defined dependencies

### The Coordinator Pattern (runTeam)

This is the framework's key feature. When `runTeam()` is called:
1. A coordinator agent receives the goal + agent roster and produces a JSON task array (title, description, assignee, dependsOn)
2. `TaskQueue` resolves dependencies topologically — independent tasks run in parallel, dependent tasks wait
3. `Scheduler` auto-assigns any unassigned tasks (strategies: `dependency-first` default, `round-robin`, `least-busy`, `capability-match`)
4. Each task result is written to `SharedMemory` so subsequent agents see prior results
5. The coordinator synthesizes all task results into a final output

### Layer Map

| Layer | Files | Responsibility |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Orchestrator | `orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`, `orchestrator/scheduler.ts` | Top-level API, task decomposition, coordinator pattern |
| Team | `team/team.ts`, `team/messaging.ts` | Agent roster, MessageBus (point-to-point + broadcast), SharedMemory binding |
| Agent | `agent/agent.ts`, `agent/runner.ts`, `agent/pool.ts`, `agent/structured-output.ts` | Agent lifecycle (idle→running→completed/error), conversation loop, concurrency pool with Semaphore, structured output validation |
| Task | `task/queue.ts`, `task/task.ts` | Dependency-aware queue, auto-unblock on completion, cascade failure to dependents |
| Tool | `tool/framework.ts`, `tool/executor.ts`, `tool/built-in/` | `defineTool()` with Zod schemas, ToolRegistry, parallel batch execution with concurrency semaphore |
| LLM | `llm/adapter.ts`, `llm/anthropic.ts`, `llm/openai.ts` | `LLMAdapter` interface (`chat` + `stream`), factory `createAdapter()` |
| Memory | `memory/shared.ts`, `memory/store.ts` | Namespaced key-value store (`agentName/key`), markdown summary injection into prompts. Custom backends via `TeamConfig.sharedMemoryStore` (any `MemoryStore` impl); `sharedMemory: true` uses the default in-process store |
| Types | `types.ts` | All interfaces in one file to avoid circular deps |
| Exports | `index.ts` | Public API surface |

### Agent Conversation Loop (AgentRunner)

`AgentRunner.run()`: send messages → extract tool-use blocks → execute tools in parallel batch → append results → loop until `end_turn` or `maxTurns` exhausted. Accumulates `TokenUsage` across all turns.

### Concurrency Control

Three semaphore layers: `AgentPool` pool-level (max concurrent agent runs, default 5), `AgentPool` per-agent mutex (serializes concurrent runs on the same `Agent` instance), and `ToolExecutor` (max concurrent tool calls, default 4).

### Structured Output

Optional `outputSchema` (Zod) on `AgentConfig`. When set, the agent's final output is parsed as JSON and validated. On validation failure, one retry with error feedback is attempted. Validated data is available via `result.structured`. Logic lives in `agent/structured-output.ts`, wired into `Agent.executeRun()`.

### Task Retry

Optional `maxRetries`, `retryDelayMs`, `retryBackoff` on task config (used via `runTasks()`). `executeWithRetry()` in `orchestrator.ts` handles the retry loop with exponential backoff (capped at 30s). Token usage is accumulated across all attempts. Emits `task_retry` event via `onProgress`.

### Error Handling

- Tool errors → caught, returned as `ToolResult(isError: true)`, never thrown
- Task failures → retry if `maxRetries > 0`, then cascade to all dependents; independent tasks continue
- LLM API errors → propagate to caller

### Built-in Tools

`bash`, `file_read`, `file_write`, `file_edit`, `grep`, `glob` — registered via `registerBuiltInTools(registry)`. `delegate_to_agent` is opt-in (`registerBuiltInTools(registry, { includeDelegateTool: true })`) and only wired up inside pool workers by `runTeam`/`runTasks` — see "Agent Delegation" below.

### Agent Delegation

`delegate_to_agent` (in `src/tool/built-in/delegate.ts`) lets an agent synchronously hand a sub-prompt to another roster agent and receive its final output as a tool result. Only active during orchestrated runs; standalone `runAgent` and the `runTeam` short-circuit path (`isSimpleGoal` hit) do not inject it.

Guards (all enforced in the tool itself, before `runDelegatedAgent` is called):

- **Self-delegation:** rejected (`target === context.agent.name`)
- **Unknown agent:** rejected (target not in team roster)
- **Cycle detection:** rejected if target already in `TeamInfo.delegationChain` (prevents `A → B → A` from burning tokens up to the depth cap)
- **Depth cap:** `OrchestratorConfig.maxDelegationDepth` (default 3)
- **Pool deadlock:** rejected when `AgentPool.availableRunSlots < 1`, without calling the pool

The delegated run's `AgentRunResult.tokenUsage` is surfaced via `ToolResult.metadata.tokenUsage`; the runner accumulates it into `totalUsage` before the next `maxTokenBudget` check, so delegation cannot silently bypass the parent's budget. Delegation tool_result blocks are exempt from `compressToolResults` and the `compact` context strategy so the parent agent retains the full sub-agent output across turns. Best-effort SharedMemory audit writes at `{caller}/delegation:{target}:{timestamp}-{rand}` if the team has shared memory enabled.

### Adding an LLM Adapter

Implement `LLMAdapter` interface with `chat(messages, options)` and `stream(messages, options)`, then register in `createAdapter()` factory in `src/llm/adapter.ts`.
